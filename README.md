# Employee-Database_SQL
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since I have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this project ,I designed the tables that hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, I performed:


1. Data Modeling


2. Data Engineering


3. Data Analysis

- Data Modeling
Inspected the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. 

- Data Engineering


Used the information I have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. #Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.


Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.



- Data Analysis
Once database was completed , I did the following:


Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.


Listed employees who were hired in 1986.


Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.


Listed the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


Listed all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."


List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


Listed all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.


In descending order, listed the frequency counts of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
